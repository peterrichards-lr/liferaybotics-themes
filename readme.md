# Liferaybotics Theme
A refresh theme for the Liferaybotics Manufacturing Demo which offers a great top navigation alternative to the traditional side menu supplied in Minium.

While this theme was built with Liferay Commerce in mind, the menu is configurable and therefore it can also be used for Liferay DXP sites as well.
